	    <h3>The goal of this project was to be able to make a piano keyboard that plays sound. We ran into a few issues with our onkeypress function and ended up making an imput statement that would still allow the user to play the music when imputing certain keys. We were even able to modify a video into a Wav file and imput it, along with some other piano keys.</h3>
