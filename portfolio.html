	    <h3>The goal of this project was to be able to make a piano keyboard that plays sound. We ran into a few issues with our onkeypress function and ended up making an imput statement that would still allow the user to play the music when imputing certain keys. We were even able to modify a video into a Wav file and imput it, along with some other piano keys.</h3>

	    <img src = "bacteriapic.PNG" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
	    <h3>For this project we were using a new platform called Net Logo. We were allowed to pick a topic that interested us and Bacterial Infection was the most interesting. The model represents how bacteria in a population becomes more resistant, which is because the more people are exposed to it the more immune everyone becomes over time.</h3>
